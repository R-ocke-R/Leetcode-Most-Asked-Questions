â€‹ Love Babber DSA Series Lec 13

Approach 1: Implemented In question SELF


The logic is very simple, calls normal BS in a loop until left most occurance is found and can be recreated. THIS LOGIC RUNS ONLY log(n) times


---


Approach 2: Optimised but changes the code/working of BS. LOVE BABBER


LOGIC RUNS 2log(n) times.


tip: when 
```
arr[mid]==i { //instead of return mid
first=mid;
e=mid-1;
```

In this way in only one call to the function we get the left most occurance.
